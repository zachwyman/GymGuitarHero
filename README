Project description: Using the tracker framework to implement parallax scrolling and sprite movement with
a custom background and custom sprites.

The easiest part of this project: Changing the while and for loops.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Parallax scrolling and the two way sprite were both difficult
to implement. It was also fairly challenging to create my own sprites and backgrounds. It was very rewarding,
however, to create my own sprites and backgrounds. It was really cool to see the stuff that I created actually
doing stuff in the game.

Notes: One of the Football helmets is a sprite, where as the other one is a two way sprite that switches directions
when it hits the wall. The video is located in the frames directory, but all of the frames to make the video were
deleted. Also, I couldn't figure out why but the video seemed very sped up.
